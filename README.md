# Auris-Bracelet

The code contained in the arduino for the music wanted to be played on the bracelet, is in the file in the "**Arduino**" folder.

The library **Adafruit_TLC5947**, was used for the communication between the arduino and the **LED Drive TLC5947**, which does the management of several analog ports at the same time. The rest of the libraries used, already come with the installation of Arduino ide.

Afterwards the table of **codes of communication** between the auris bracelet and auris server is presented.
